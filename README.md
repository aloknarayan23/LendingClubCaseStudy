## General Information
- Problem: 
		When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
          ~If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
          ~If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

- Agenda :
		To identify driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default which the company can utilize for its portfolio and risk    assessment.
